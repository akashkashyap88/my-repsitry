    By 2047, the government's "Viksit Bharat" (Developed India) vision aims to transform India into a prosperous, self-reliant, developed nation with world-class infrastructure, robust economic growth, technological advancement, and improved quality of life for its citizens. Projections suggest India could have one of the world's largest economies, a vast digital market, and a significant shift towards sustainable technologies, though the government also needs to focus on inclusive economic participation and streamlined governance to achieve these goals.

<h3>Self-Reliance:</h3> A key objective is to foster self-reliance through economic participation for all citizens. 
<h3>Digitalization & Education:</h3> India could see a massive increase in internet users and a large, educated workforce, potentially becoming a leading global market in these sectors. 
<h2>Infrastructure & Technology</h2>
<h3>World-Class Infrastructure:</h3> The vision includes world-class infrastructure to support seamless connectivity, efficient transportation, and sustainable urbanization. 
<h3>Technological Upgradation:</h3> Technological advancement and innovation are central to this vision, including the adoption of electric vehicles and green technologies.
